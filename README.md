A scientific calculator is a type of electronic calculator, usually but not always handheld, designed to calculate problems in science, engineering, and mathematics.
Modern scientific calculators generally have many more features than a standard four or five-function calculator, and the feature set differs between manufacturers and models; however, the defining features of a scientific calculator include:

scientific notation
floating point arithmetic
logarithmic functions, using both base 10 and base e
trigonometric functions (some including hyperbolic trigonometry)
exponential functions and roots beyond the square root
quick access to constants such as pi and e.
